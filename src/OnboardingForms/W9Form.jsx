            scholarship income received by a Chinese student temporarily present

            resident alien for tax purposes if their stay in the United States
            exceeds 5 calendar years. However, paragraph 2 of the first Protocol

            provisions of Article 20 to continue to apply even after the Chinese
            student becomes a resident alien of the United States. A Chinese
            student who qualifies for this exception (under paragraph 2 of the
            first Protocol) and is relying on this exception to claim an
            exemption from tax on their scholarship or fellowship income would

              </h2>
              <p>
                Identity theft occurs when someone uses your personal
                information such as your name, SSN, or other identifying
                information, without your permission, to commit fraud or other
                crimes. An identity thief may use your SSN to get a job or may
                file a tax return using your SSN to receive a refund.
              </p>
              <p>To reduce your risk:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-outside pl-5 space-y-1">
                <li>Protect your SSN,</li>
                <li>Ensure your employer is protecting your SSN, and</li>
                <li>Be careful when choosing a tax return preparer.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                If your tax records are affected by identity theft and you
                receive a notice from the IRS, respond right away to the name
                and phone number printed on the IRS notice or letter.
              </p>
              <p>
                If your tax records are not currently affected by identity theft
                but you think you are at risk due to a lost or stolen purse or
                wallet, questionable credit card activity or credit report,
                contact the IRS Identity Theft Hotline at 1-800-908-4490 or
                submit Form 14039.

              <p>
                Identity theft is the creation or use of email and websites
                designed to mimic legitimate business emails and websites. The
                most common act is to send an email to a user, falsely claiming
                to be an established legitimate enterprise in an attempt to
                scare the user into surrendering private information that can be
                used for identity theft.
              </p>
              <p>
                The IRS does not initiate contacts with taxpayers via emails.
                Also, the IRS does not request personal detailed information
                through email or ask a taxpayer for his/her financial or
                personal PIN from emails. Do not give out financial information,
                for their credit card, bank, or other financial accounts.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you receive an unsolicited email claiming to be from the IRS,
                forward this message to{" "}
                <em className="italic">phishing@irs.gov</em>. You may also
                report misuse of the IRS name, logo, or other IRS property to
                the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) at
                800-366-4484. You can forward suspicious emails to the Federal

              <p>
                Section 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code requires you to
                provide your correct TIN to persons (including federal agencies)
                who are required to file information returns with the IRS to
                report interest, dividends, and certain other income paid to
                you, mortgage interest you paid, the acquisition or abandonment
                of secured property, the cancellation of debt, or contributions
                you made to an IRA, Archer MSA, or HSA. The IRS uses the TINs
                for identification purposes and to help to facilitate the
                matching of information returns with the appropriate tax
                returns. The IRS may also give this information to the
                Department of Justice for civil and criminal litigation and to
                cities, states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. commonwealths
                and territories for use in administering their laws. The
                information may also be disclosed to other countries under a
                treaty, to federal and state agencies to enforce civil and
                criminal laws, or to federal law enforcement and intelligence
                agencies to combat terrorism. You must provide your TIN whether
                or not you are required to file a tax return. Under section
                3406, payors must generally withhold a percentage of taxable
                interest, dividends, and certain other payments to a payee who
                does not give a TIN to the payor. Certain penalties may also
                apply for providing false or fraudulent information.
